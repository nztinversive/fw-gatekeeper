# Face Encoding Service

FastAPI service for face encoding and matching, used by fw-gatekeeper.

Detection uses the OpenCV Haar cascade bundled with `opencv-python-headless`;
recognition uses the InsightFace buffalo_s MobileFaceNet ONNX model (~13MB, downloaded
at image build time).

## Endpoints

- `GET /health` — `{ status, version, rec_model, rec_exists, min_pairwise_similarity, min_good_photos }`
- `POST /encode` — `{ photos: string[] }` → `{ encoding: number[], photos: PhotoResult[], used_photo_indexes: number[] }`
- `POST /match` — `{ photo: string, encodings: [{ worker_id, encoding }] }` → `{ match: { worker_id, confidence } | null }`

Photos are base64 JPEG data URLs. Matching uses cosine similarity with a 0.4 threshold.

`POST /encode` and `POST /match` require the `x-face-service-key` header to match
`FACE_SERVICE_KEY`. `GET /health` remains public for deployment and dashboard health checks.
Set `FACE_SERVICE_ALLOWED_ORIGINS` to a comma-separated list of trusted dashboard origins;
it defaults to `https://fw-gatekeeper.onrender.com` and rejects wildcard configuration.

## Enrollment quality gate (`POST /encode`)

Every enrollment photo is checked before it can contribute to a worker's reference
vector. There is no center-crop fallback: a frame without a detectable face is never
encoded.

Each photo gets a `PhotoResult` of `{ index, ok, reason }` where `reason` is one of:

- `ok` — exactly one clearly detected face
- `no_face` — nothing detected
- `multiple_faces` — a second face at least 40% the area of the largest one
- `decode_error` — the data URL could not be decoded as an image

Embeddings of the `ok` photos must agree pairwise at cosine >= `MIN_PAIRWISE_SIMILARITY`.
If they do not, the photo with the lowest mean similarity to the others is dropped once;
if the remainder still disagree, none are used. At least `MIN_GOOD_PHOTOS` consistent
photos are required. The `encoding` is the L2-normalised mean of the used photos only,
and `used_photo_indexes` lists which request indexes contributed.

When the gate fails the service responds `422` with a structured `detail`:

```json
{
  "detail": {
    "message": "Enrollment needs at least 2 clear, matching photos of one face: 2 of 3 photos could not be used (no face detected). Retake the photos facing the camera in good light.",
    "photos": [
      { "index": 0, "ok": false, "reason": "no_face" },
      { "index": 1, "ok": true, "reason": "ok" },
      { "index": 2, "ok": false, "reason": "no_face" }
    ],
    "disagreeing_pairs": [[0, 2, 0.31]]
  }
}
```

`disagreeing_pairs` entries are `[index_a, index_b, cosine_similarity]` over the request
photo indexes. The dashboard's `/api/enroll` route forwards `message` as `error` together
with `photos` and `disagreeing_pairs`, and the enrollment page lists them under the error.

### Environment knobs

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `MIN_PAIRWISE_SIMILARITY` | `0.6` | Minimum cosine similarity between every pair of used enrollment embeddings |
| `MIN_GOOD_PHOTOS` | `2` | Minimum number of consistent single-face photos required to enroll |
| `FACE_MODEL_DIR` | `/app/models` | Where the recognition model is stored/downloaded |

Both thresholds are read at startup, so they can be tuned on the deployment without a
rebuild. `GET /health` echoes the active values.

## Run

```bash
export FACE_SERVICE_KEY="replace-with-a-long-random-secret"
py -m pip install -r requirements.txt
py main.py
# or: start.bat
```

Runs on port 5557.

## Tests

```bash
python3 face-service/test_face_auth.py
python3 face-service/test_encode_quality.py
```

`test_encode_quality.py` needs `numpy` for the consistency unit tests and `fastapi` +
`httpx2` for the `/encode` endpoint tests (OpenCV and ONNX Runtime are stubbed; no model
or image is needed). If the system `python3` lacks them, either
`python3 -m pip install numpy fastapi httpx2 Pillow` or run the file with a venv
interpreter, e.g. `~/fsvenv/bin/python face-service/test_encode_quality.py`. Missing
packages make the affected tests skip with a warning rather than fail.
