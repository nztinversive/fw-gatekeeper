"""Commit-pinned download and SHA-256 verification of the kiosk face model.

Pure standard library (no numpy/cv2) so it can be unit tested on any machine.

The kiosk and the face service MUST embed faces with byte-identical models:
if either side silently picked up a different upstream file, every match
would fail. Both therefore pin the same HuggingFace commit and digest.

Re-pin procedure (update ALL of the following together):
  1. sha=$(curl -sS https://huggingface.co/api/models/immich-app/buffalo_s | jq -r .sha)
  2. curl -sSL -o /tmp/rec.onnx \
       "https://huggingface.co/immich-app/buffalo_s/resolve/$sha/recognition/model.onnx"
  3. sha256sum /tmp/rec.onnx
  4. Set MODEL_COMMIT and REC_MODEL_SHA256 here, and the matching values in
     face-service/model_pinning.py and face-service/Dockerfile.
  5. Re-enroll or re-verify workers if the recognition model actually changed.
